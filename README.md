# airbnb-clone-project

# Project Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.


# Project Goals
- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


# Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.


# Team Roles
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.


# Database Design 
Entities and fields
- Users { user_id, email, Contact }

- Properties { property_id, property_location }
  
- Bookings { booking_id, customer_name }
  
- Payments { payment_id,  booking_id }
  
- Reviews { user_id, review_category }

# API Security
1. Authentication
Method: Token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) via Django REST Framework SimpleJWT.

Purpose: Ensures that only registered and verified users can access protected endpoints.

Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access to personal data, such as booking details and payment history.

2. Authorization
Method: Role-based access control (RBAC), differentiating between regular users, hosts, and admins.

Purpose: Restricts what each user type can access or modify—for example, only property owners can edit their listings.

Why it matters: Prevents misuse of privileges and ensures users can only perform actions they are permitted to.

3. Rate Limiting
Tool: Django Ratelimit or integration with API gateways like NGINX or Cloudflare.

Purpose: Limits the number of requests a user/IP can make in a given time.

Why it matters: Prevents brute force attacks, DoS attempts, and abuse of endpoints (e.g., spamming bookings).

4. HTTPS Enforcement
Deployment Practice: Use SSL certificates to enforce HTTPS in production.

Purpose: Encrypts data in transit between the client and the server.

Why it matters: Protects sensitive information like passwords and credit card details from interception.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization
Tool: Django’s built-in form validation and DRF serializer validation.

Purpose: Validates all inputs and strips out potentially harmful data (e.g., SQL injections, XSS).

Why it matters: Prevents injection attacks that could compromise the system.

6. Secure Storage of Sensitive Data
Method: Passwords are hashed using Django's default PBKDF2 algorithm. Payment credentials, if stored, must be encrypted or tokenized via a third-party provider like Stripe.

Why it matters: Even if the database is compromised, sensitive information cannot be easily exploited.

7. CSRF Protection
Tool: Django’s built-in CSRF middleware (mainly for browser-based endpoints).

Why it matters: Protects authenticated users from unauthorized actions triggered from malicious sites.




# CI/CD Pipeline
A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline ensures that code changes are automatically tested and deployed, enabling faster and more reliable development.

What is CI/CD?
CI (Continuous Integration): Automatically runs tests and checks each time code is pushed to the repository. It ensures that new code integrates well with the existing system.

CD (Continuous Deployment): Automatically deploys code to the staging or production environment after successful integration and testing.

Why CI/CD is Important for This Project
Faster Releases: Developers can ship features like new booking flows or payment options quickly.

Reduced Bugs: Automated testing in CI detects errors early before they reach production.

Consistency: Ensures all deployments are done in the same repeatable way using Docker containers.

Team Collaboration: Multiple developers can contribute simultaneously without integration conflicts.

Tools to Use
GitHub Actions: For running unit tests, linting, and automating Docker builds/pushes.

Docker: To containerize the Django app, ensuring consistent behavior across development and production.

Heroku / PythonAnywhere / Render: As the hosting platform to deploy the app with ease.

PostgreSQL Add-ons: For managing the live database environment.
